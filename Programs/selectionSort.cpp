//Selection Sort Algorithm: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm 
// 							in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
// 							Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
// 							The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element 
// 							becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to right

// Worst complexity: n^2 i.e-  O(nÂ²)
// Average complexity: n^2
// Best complexity: n^2
// Space complexity: 1
// Method: Selection
// Stable: No
// Class: Comparison sort
